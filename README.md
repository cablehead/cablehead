Do you like clipboard managers? Me too!

I'm making one. It's called [Stacks](https://stacks.cross.stream), https://github.com/cablehead/stacks.

 ðŸ¤« don't tell anyone, but Stacks is actually the UI for [`xs`](https://github.com/cablehead/xs), a local-first [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) store I'm making.

Kinda like sqlite, but for event streams
