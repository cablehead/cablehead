ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [@ndyg](https://ndyg.ca).

I make a local-first, [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) store called [cross.stream](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/). It's kinda like sqlite, but for event streams.

I think a lot about, what would it look like to compose systems and applications exclusively out of small tools? That's led to [`http-nu`](https://github.com/cablehead/http-nu) a surprisingly performant, Nushell-scriptable HTTP server that fits in your back pocket.

I make a few other things, like a clipboard manager, called
[Stacks](https://stacks.cross.stream), https://github.com/cablehead/stacks.

ðŸ¤« don't tell anyone, but Stacks is actually a prototype UI for [cross.stream](https://www.cross.stream)
